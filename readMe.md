# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is a simple project aimed at visualizing various sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms manipulate data to achieve a sorted sequence. This project serves as an educational tool to help users understand sorting algorithms visually.

## Features

- Visualization of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- User-friendly interface for selecting sorting algorithms and customizing input data.
- Real-time visualization updates to observe the sorting process step by step.
- Adjustable speed control to slow down or speed up the sorting visualization.
- Color-coded bars representing elements in the array, facilitating easy tracking of sorting progress.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
- Git version control for project management and collaboration.
- GitHub Pages for hosting the live demo of the Sorting Visualizer.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Adjust the slider to set the size of the array to be sorted.

4. Click the "Generate Array" button to create a random array.

5. Select the sorting algorithm
